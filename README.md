# Movies-ETL

## Purpose

Amazing Prime has asked us to create an automated pipeline that will allow the movies dataset we previously created for the Hackathon to be updated on a daily basis. First, we wrote an ETL function to read three data files, two of which were from Wikipedia and Kaggle. We then extracted and transformed the data. Finally, we uploaded it into a PostgreSQL database. The company now has the abilty to add new data as they see fit. The pipeline will allow them to perform transformations and load their data into existing tables.
